## How to run locally

### Prerequisites

- [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/) >= 10
- [Netlify CLI](https://docs.netlify.com/cli/get-started/#installation)
- [Stripe CLI](https://stripe.com/docs/stripe-cli)

Follow the steps below to run locally.

**1. Clone and configure the sample**

```
git clone https://github.com/stripe-samples/checkout-netlify-serverless
```

Copy the .env.example file into a file named .env in the functions folder. For example:

```
cp .env.example .env
```

You will need a Stripe account in order to run the demo. Once you set up your account, go to the Stripe [developer dashboard](https://stripe.com/docs/development#api-keys) to find your API keys.

```
STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=<replace-with-your-publishable-key>
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=<replace-with-your-secret-key>
```

**2. Run Netlify Functions locally:**

You can run the Netlify Functions locally with Netlify Dev:

```
npm run functions
netlify dev
```

**3. [Optional] Run a webhook locally:**

If you want to test the `using-webhooks` integration with a local webhook on your machine, you can use the Stripe CLI to easily spin one up.

Make sure to [install the CLI](https://stripe.com/docs/stripe-cli) and [link your Stripe account](https://stripe.com/docs/stripe-cli#link-account).

In a separate tab run

```
stripe listen --forward-to localhost:8888/.netlify/functions/handle-purchase
```

Or use the shorthand `npm run webhook`

The CLI will print a webhook secret key to the console. Set `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` to this value in your .env file.

You should see events logged in the console where the CLI is running.

When you are ready to create a live webhook endpoint, follow our guide in the docs on [configuring a webhook endpoint in the dashboard](https://stripe.com/docs/webhooks/setup#configure-webhook-settings).
